        <p class="card-text">The first iPhone was announced by one of the founders of apple, Steve Jobs, on January 9th, 2007. This device would soon change the world forever... The iPhone was a small 8GB computer that could fit in your pocket. It had many functions, such as; calling someone, listening to music, social media, it's own built in web browser that was connected to the internet, etc. The best part about it, is that it was touch screen unlike flip phones (the device most dominant in the cell-phone industry). People started to call the device "The flip Phone Killer" because it took the world by storm. </p>

        <p class="card-text">The first apple computer was invented on April 1st, 1971. Once purchased for $666, the device came with only with 1 motherboard, a keyboard, and wires to hook up to a TV (the TV was not included). This device was very limited, only being used by programmers to write basic code. Why would you buy it? you may ask... Well, back in that era, many computers have to be hooked up to bulky/large, high end, expensive moniters. The apple 1 however, only needed a simple monitor such as a TV which was already normal thing to have in the day. </p>
